This solves two problems: It helps restaurants to improve their online presence through recommendations towards bloggers and influencers (from now on, foodies) who seek new places and experiences; and it simultaneously helps customers to be recognized professionally thanks to the reviews and metrics system through collaborations. </p>

          <p class="paragraph highlight">Components had to be identifiable with a minimum amount of color and space. So we mainly used size and contrast to build a visual hierarchy. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Each type of collaboration required different information. However, all collaborations shared a same pattern. Among the important information displayed, the common points were:<br>• The discount in the offer<br>• A date range (individual collabs) or specific date (foodie meetings)<br>• The number of companions (individual) or guests (meetings)</p>
          <p class="paragraph">But the most important piece of information was different for restaurants and foodies. Restaurants needed to have an overview of all the collaborations in the same campaign. In the case of the foodies, it was the restaurant&#x27;s name.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">We decided to build a similar component for both views, sharing the same design structure through the platform.<span></span></p>
          <p class="paragraph">Ruben and Isaac wanted a clean and not too-colorful interface, so I decided to utilize basic colors (green for confirmation, blue for accent, yellow for alert, and red for deletion) and the same palette for the tags. We decided that the default collaboration would be an individual and private invitation, and made a tag for public collaborations and foodie meetings. </p>

          <p class="paragraph">After their first launch and with some clients and traction, Ruben and Isaac contacted me again to make some improvements in Solofoodies. They also had a new logo built and brand colors, and wanted to modify the UI to match their new visual identity. We redefined some colors to match the brand, but kept the product&#x27;s UI bright and clean. </p>
          <p class="paragraph highlight">We reworked all the UX and UI visuals of the product, from the onboarding to every detail of the collaborations.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">They collected a lot of feedback from users, especially from restaurants. For example, there were users creating collab invitations for two different days of the week separately because they could only choose between &quot;weekday&quot; and &quot;weekend&quot;. We reworked the design of the weekdays, so they could customize it more easily. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Another example is how restaurant users couldn&#x27;t recognize the different collaborations that they made. Displaying the invited foodies&#x27; pictures wasn&#x27;t an option from the beginning due to technical reasons. The final solution was to show the names of the foodies in the collaboration. <br></p>
          <p class="paragraph">We also redesigned the way restaurants made their invitation, showing step-by-step how they were creating the new collaboration card. This would help them to situate all the information on the card.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">We needed foodies to upload the collaboration posts and make them visible for the restaurant.

      <div class="project-tldr-description">Like many other startup projects, Solofoodies wasn&#x27;t the exception and they needed things to be done in with a short budget. Thus, like most times, I couldn&#x27;t do proper research and test myself. However, by good fortune, I got the opportunity to iterate on the product design. That taught me many things:<br></div>
      <div class="project-tldr-description">First, I reconfirmed the importance of user testing and user feedback. Without that, it would&#x27;ve ended up being one more good-looking project for Dribbble/Behance. Instead, I got valuable information and the opportunity to improve it and learn from my own mistakes. As a freelance, you can work on a lot of projects, and with time get faster at the execution of your work, but you only get better when you iterate. <br></div>
      <div class="project-tldr-description">I found it valuable to keep working on the same project long-term, to learn more from the users and even from mistakes that I can make. Receiving the opportunity of fixing and improving a product that you made in the past is not common as a freelance. </div>
      <div class="project-tldr-description">I consider this project as one of the catalysts that encouraged me to look for a stable project that I can keep working on, iterating, evolving, and growing. To make a real impact on the project.</div>
